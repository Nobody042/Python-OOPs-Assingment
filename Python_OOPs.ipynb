        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes. These objects represent real-world entities and can contain data (called attributes or properties) and behavior (called methods or functions).\n",

        "**Key Concepts of OOP**:\n",

        "1.Class\n",
        "\n",
        "A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "Example: A Car class may have properties like color and speed, and methods like drive() or brake().\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Object\n",
        "\n",
        "An instance of a class. It holds actual values for the properties and can use the methods defined in the class.\n",

        "Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (the class), and restricting access to some components.\n",

        "4.Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.\n",

        "- Inheritance: A child class inherits methods and properties from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method Overriding: A child class can override methods of the parent class, providing its own implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dynamic Method Binding: At runtime, Python will automatically call the overridden method of the child class, even if the method is called on a reference to the parent class.\n",

        "    class Animal:\n",

        "- Polymorphism allows you to use a single interface (speak()) for objects of different classes (Animal, Dog, Cat).\n",
        "\n",
        "- The method invoked is determined by the actual object type at runtime, not the reference type, enabling dynamic behavior.\n",

        "\n",
        "Polymorphism with inheritance in Python allows child classes to override parent class methods, and when called via a common parent reference, the correct method is chosen based on the actual object type at runtime.\n",
